# Contributor's Guide

## Introduction

We follow [ZeroMQ's C4 Process](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22), a
collaboration model for free software projects that focuses on community
success and shared ownership.

## How To Contribute

1. Every patch should correspond to an [Issue](https://github.com/hassy/chaos-lambda/issues).
2. For sending PRs, please use the [Fork+Pull](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) process.
3. Once your PR is merged, please send a PR adding yourself to the [contributors list](README.md#contributors).

### Patch Requirements

Quoted from the [C4 Spec](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22):

> * Maintainers and Contributors MUST have a Platform account and SHOULD use their real names or a well-known alias.
> * A patch SHOULD be a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one identified and agreed problem.
> * A patch MUST adhere to the code style guidelines of the project if these are defined.
> * A patch MUST adhere to the "Evolution of Public Contracts" guidelines defined below.
> * A patch SHALL NOT include non-trivial code from other projects unless the Contributor is the original author of that code.
> * A patch MUST compile cleanly and pass project self-tests on at least the principle target platform.
> * A patch commit message SHOULD consist of a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, optionally followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description.
> * A "Correct Patch" is one that satisfies the above requirements.

Happy hacking!
